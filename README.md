# UTM_Tracker_Django_Implementation
 The UTM Tracker is a Django-based web application that enables tracking and storing UTM parameters (UTM source and UTM medium) when users click on advertisement cards. The UTM parameters are included in the URL of the advertisement page, and upon reaching the advertisement page, the UTM parameters are retrieved and stored in the Django administration database.
